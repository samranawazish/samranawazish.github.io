Hi, I am Samra Nawazish, currently a Research Intern at <a href="https://im.itu.edu.pk/">Intelligent Machines Lab</a> at ITU supervised by <a href="https://waqassultani.github.io/">Dr. Waqas Sultani</a>. Previously, I completed my MSc in Software Engineering at the [UET Taxila](http://uettaxila.edu.pk/), where I was kindly supervised by [Dr. Ali Javed](https://fms.uettaxila.edu.pk/Profile/ali.javed).

My research focuses on the analysis of medical images for disease prediction and classification, particularly in settings with limited labeled data (few shot/zero shot). I work on developing deep learning methods that can extract clinically meaningful features from modalities such as MRI, microscopy, and histopathology images. The goal is to enable accurate diagnosis using few-shot and data-efficient approaches, reducing reliance on large annotated datasets while improving model generalization to rare conditions and real-world clinical variations. 

Currently, I am working on microscopic image enhancement and stitching, as well as medical data segmentation and detection, with a focus on improving the quality and reliability of biomedical image analysis. My work involves developing data-efficient deep learning methods that support disease prediction and clinical decision-making, even when annotated samples are limited.
